            <h1 id="charting">Charting</h1>
                <p>OpenTaiko uses the TJA format for charting songs. They can be opened with any text editor, or with a visual editor such as PeepoDrumKit. Below is a list of note types used.</p>

                <h2 id="note-types">Note Types</h2>
                <p>There are many notes supported by OpenTaiko. Some are commonly used in every chart, while others appear less often. Some may also be exclusive to other modes, or have different behaviors.</p>

            <h1 id="skinning">Skinning & Customization</h1>
                <p>In addition to OpenTaiko's default skins, users are able to create their own skins.</p>

                <h2 id="lua-scripting">Lua Scripting</h2>
                <p>OpenTaiko's Lua API allows creators to further customize their skin beyond just replacing textures and sounds, allowing for more dynamic visuals without the need to modify the game's source code. While most menus can have Lua scripts, most scripts are only suited for animating backgrounds at this time. The capabilities of the Lua API are still a work in progress, and will expand in the future.</p>
                <p>Read-only variables are also provided by OpenTaiko, allowing the creator to change the behavior of their script based on what is happening at that moment.</p>
                <p>Some examples of what can be done with Lua include :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being able to read the BPM, gauge percentage, go-go state, and clear status of each active player, and change how visuals are animated using these values.</li>
                    <li>Checking what language the user is currently using, allowing for localization support for skins.</li>
                    <li>Changing the visuals of a background depending on their Tower progress or AI battle state.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3 id="calling-functions">Calling Functions</h3>
                    <p>Calling Functions are commands that you send to OpenTaiko to execute a function.</p>
                    <p>Most of these functions are related to drawing and manipulating textures that your script imports, and does not modify the game itself.</p>
